### Q1. Git Tools (3 points)
The thee most common git commands that you will use in this class are commit, push, and pull. Describe each of these commands (in a sentence or two). Here is a link to a [github cheatsheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

### Q2. Linear Model Specification
One major take away from this class is that many different statistical models can be expressed in linear model notation. Using the OKCupid dataset for motivation write out linear models for the following statistical models. Make sure to clearly define all notation.

Then fit the appropriate model using R and interpret the results.

#### a. t-test (6 points)
A two-sample t-test designed to determine if there are differences in height between users self reporting the body type as `athletic` and `average`.

#### b one-way ANOVA (6 points)
A one way ANOVA designed to determine if there are differences in height between users self reporting the body type as:
`athletic`, `average`, `fit`, and `thin`.
